The short version: each player gets a score from a blend of four advanced stats based on their top five seasons. The upgrade pick is a player that was drafted lower but has a higher score. Squads are made up of the biggest score upgrades. See the <a href=#method>method section</a> for more details.","teamsTitle":"Drafting is hard. Here is how often each team selects the best player available in the first round.","teamsDek":"Select a team below to see their player report card.","teams1":"A draftee’s grade is based on how big of a gap there is between their score and the best player available. More recent draftees will have less extreme scores since their best production seasons are still ahead of them. For example, while Markelle Fultz appears to be a bust, he is being compared to Tatum/Mitchell, who will likely widen that score gap as they hit their primes.","histogramTitle":"The over and underachievers of every modern NBA draft class through 2017","histogram1":"Tk some chatter.","method1":"Data from <a href=https://basketball-reference.com target=_blank>Basketball Reference</a>.

No all-in-one advanced stat is perfect, so I chose a blend that satisfied the eye test (see <a href=#method-table>table below</a>).Each stat was normalized to a 1-100 then averaged together to create a master scale. Scores were based on a player’s top five seasons to find the balance between prime and longevity (an average NBA career is 4.5 years). Upgrade choices in the Could Have Been teams were first selected from top 10 picks, then searched beyond those if there weren’t enough.","method2":"Report card grades method tk."}
